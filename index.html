                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="intro-text">Hey there! I'm Massa Coulibaly, a tech enthusiast and data science nerd originally from the beautiful Côte d'Ivoire. Currently, I'm living my best life in Berkeley, California, where I'm diving deep into the world of Information Management and Systems at UC Berkeley.
                    When I'm not crunching numbers or coding up a storm, you'll likely find me in my happy place – making music. I'm an independent music producer, and there's nothing quite like the thrill of creating a new track. It's my way of balancing out all that left-brain activity with some right-brain creativity.
                    Speaking of balance, I'm also a big volleyball fan. There's something amazing about the teamwork and strategy involved in a good game. It's a bit like data science, actually – you need to read the situation, make quick decisions, and work together to achieve your goal.
                    My journey has taken me from Carnegie Mellon University (For my Bachelor's) to projects in Ghana, Qatar, and back to the US. I love using my tech skills to make a real difference, whether it's helping a healthcare clinic go digital or predicting the next big hit song.
                    Oh, and I'm a bit of a language nerd too. I speak English and French fluently (thanks to my Ivorian roots), and I'm always up for practicing my Spanish or German. I believe that understanding different languages helps me understand different perspectives – super useful in both data science and life!
